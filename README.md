This C++ program reads and analyzes data from an imported file, performs calculations using 2-D arrays, and outputs the results both to the command prompt and an output file.

Features
Data Import: Reads a dataset from an input file.
2-D Array Analysis: Uses nested loops to process and analyze values stored in a 2-dimensional array.
Average Depth Calculation: Includes a function to compute the average depth of the dataset, with the array passed as an argument.
Command Prompt Output: Displays the results (such as average depth and other calculated values) directly to the command prompt.
File Output: Writes the results to an output file.
Endless Loop with Break Option: Allows continuous processing in an endless loop, with the ability to break out when desired.
